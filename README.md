# Aurora End-to-end tests

## Project stack details

Project uses Synpress V4, Playwright, TypeScript, Metamask.

MetaMask extension of Chrome is used for testing wallet functionality. [More information](https://metamask.io/)
</br>Synpress is framework made to MetaMask actions. [More information](https://synpress.io/)
</br>Playwright is Javascript/ TypeScript testing framework. [More information](https://playwright.dev/)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> </br>Currently Synpress has a limitation on supported OSes and only support UNIX based operating systems. Please note that if it's required to run tests on Windows machine, user could do this with WSL. [More about WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)

## Project preparation

### Installation

After downloading code from repository, you must install dependencies with command:
```bash
yarn install
```

### Environmental variables
> [!IMPORTANT]
> </br>Sensitive information must be stored locally in .env file, or as variable/ secret in repository options.

A sample .env file can be generated as follows:
```
cp .env.sample .env
```

### Wallet configuration

You must have at least one wallet config and cache.
Currently there are few wallet configs, e.g.:
</br>[Aurora Plus Wallet MainNet Setup](.\test\wallet-setup\aurora-plus.setup.ts)
</br>[NEAR Wallet MainNet Setup](.\test\wallet-setup\near-web3-prod.setup.ts)
</br>[NEAR Wallet TestNet Setup](.\test\wallet-setup\near-web3-test.setup.ts)

As it's not safe to publish cache information in repository, before running tests you have to cache it on your machine. To do so, use command:
```bash
yarn synpress
```

### Running tests
There are tests for multiple websites.
If required, you can run all the tests, of all websites at the same time with command:
```bash
yarn test
```

If it's required to run only tests for specific website, you can use tags:
```bash
yarn test --grep @tag-name
```

See [tests/helpers/constants/tags.ts](./tests/helpers/constants/tags.ts) for a list of the available
tags.

> [!CAUTION]
> </br>If you are using a new wallet, and automatic tests keeps failing, please try to go through STAKING scenario manually, as it might be required to agree some metamask steps once.

## Tests development

### Folders structure
Project follows `POM - Page Object Model` design pattern.
</br>In short: pages information, helper methods and other logic split into smaller parts for easier maintainability/ readability.

Below is the structure of folders/ files required for tests development. It does not contain information about the files that will be generated automatically, e.g.: synpress cache or reports.

```
ðŸ“¦
â”œâ”€Â .github
â”‚Â Â â””â”€Â workflows
â”‚Â Â Â Â Â â””â”€Â *.yml          (Config of Github actions pipeline)
â””â”€Â test
 Â Â â”œâ”€Â wallet-setup       (Place to save wallet config files)
   â”‚Â Â â””â”€Â *setup.ts      (Wallet config)
Â Â Â â”œâ”€Â helpers           (Place to save files of shared content, e.g.: constants, methods)
Â Â Â â”‚Â Â â””â”€Â constants
   â”‚    â””â”€Â *.ts         (Constants for various shared info, e.g.: timeouts, urls, tags)
Â Â Â â””â”€Â page_*
Â Â Â Â Â Â â”œâ”€Â fixtures
      â”‚  â””â”€Â *.ts        (Fixtures used for describing preconditions)
Â Â Â Â Â Â â”œâ”€Â pages
      â”‚  â””â”€Â *.page.ts   (Place to describe page related selectors or methods)
Â Â Â Â Â Â â””â”€Â specs
         â””â”€Â *.spec.ts   (Spec files used to place steps of tests)

```

### Wallet folder
If any additional wallet will be required, please follow the steps below:
</br>1. Create a new file in ```/test/wallet-setup``` folder
</br>2. File should follow naming pattern ```*.setup.ts``` - [more details](https://synpress.io/docs/guides/wallet-cache#file-name)
</br>3. Define wallet details. Use existing wallet as example, or official documentation - [more details](https://synpress.io/docs/guides/wallet-cache#define-the-wallet-setup)
</br>4. After defining a new wallet, you can create a new cache, by using command:
```bash
yarn synpress
```

### Fixtures folder
Fixture files should contain logic/ tests steps that works as prerequisites for multiple tests, E.g.: logging in to wallet or the websites.

### Helpers folder
Helpers folder should contain only information which supposed to be reused in multiple places, e.g.: constants with tags or timeouts, might be some API calls which should be used not on a single project

### Pages folder
Place where all the logic should go. Not only page selectors goes here, but the major part of logic.

### Specs folder
Spec files is the actual test files. While developing tests you should awoid of placing any logic here as much as it's possible.

## Reporting
Project uses "HTML" reporter, which is one of the default option for Playwright.
More information about this reporter you can find [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters#html-reporter).

Please note that the reports currently works only on local environment!
You can launch reports with the following command:
```bash
yarn report
```

## Pipelines
All the pipeline configurations you can find in .github/workflows.
For tests automation configuration file you can refer to tests-automation.yml

Pipeline triggered on push and every 12 hours.

For checking result of pipeline run, you can go to repository -> Actions -> finished Tests-Automation job.
You can download pipeline run report in ended pipeline, by opening Upload-artifact step and clicking artifact URL.
